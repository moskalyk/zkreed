# zkReed

zkreed is a proof of concept tarot game, assembled to numeric arithmetic signifiers for inspection. like "counting cards" for tarots.

oracles can peek into subtle energetic variations from cryptograhically proven pre-compiled circuits
where for 9 card readings, oracle's card placements become adjusted for equilibrium testing

e.g

| [ -2 ] | _3_ | [  ] | *			| [ 1 ] | _3_ | [  ] | 
|  _1_   | ___ |  __  |		vs		|  _1_  | ___ |  __  |  
| [   ]  | ___ | [  ] |				| [   ] | ___ | [  ] |

querents can share numerology essence, without revealing cards.
